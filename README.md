### Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
'''
git clone https://github.com/your-username/alx-higher_level_programming.git
'''

2. Navigate to the project directory.

'''
cd alx-higher_level_programming
'''

3. Start exploring the projects and scripts in the respective directories.

### Projects

Here's a list of projects I've worked on during my learning journey:

Project 1: Introductory Project

'''
cd 0x00-python-hello_world
'''

Description: In this repository I'm embarking on a Python journey from basic "Hello, World!" scripts to hands-on projects, exploring scripting, file manipulation, web scraping, and more.

### Coding Levels

I've organized my projects based on coding levels:

Beginner: Projects designed for those just starting with programming.
Intermediate: Projects that require a bit more complexity and knowledge.
Advanced: Projects that challenge and expand my understanding of high-level languages.
Feel free to explore projects at different levels based on your current skill set.

### Resources

I'll be curating a list of resources that I find helpful in my learning journey. Check the resources directory for books, tutorials, and articles.
